I am Emanoel Lopes, Software Engineer focused in Front-End Development (and most all the time, a problem solver) from Brazil, and I work with web development since 2013 in digital agencies, B2C and B2B plataforms, products and softwares as a service and some jobs as a freelancer programmer.

Actually I work at [VAGAS Tecnologia](https://vagas.com.br/), a company based in Sao Paulo City, focused on the development of scalable applications that help people to get employed and companies find the best collaborators.

Enthusiastic about new technologies, which allows me to be in constant learning. Self-taught, proactive and always positive. I like to scour the web through solutions but never dispense a good book.
