# Hi, everyone!

I am Emanoel Lopes, Front-End Software Engineer (and most all the time, a problem solver) from Brazil, and I work with web development since 2013 in digital agencies, B2C and B2B plataforms, products and softwares as a service and some jobs as a freelancer programmer.

Enthusiastic about new technologies which allow me to be in constant learning. Usually self-taught, proactive and always positive.
