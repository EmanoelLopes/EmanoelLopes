# Hi, everyone!

I am Emanoel Lopes, Senior Front-End Software Engineer (and most all the time, a problem solver) from Brazil, actually working at [Luizalabs](https://github.com/luizalabs). I deal with web development since 2013 and I did a lot of cool stuff all the way since there. 

In my free time, I use to be a street runner, and I also take time to take care of my physical and mental health through fitness activities and personal hobbies. Oh, and I am also the guardian of 5 cats.
