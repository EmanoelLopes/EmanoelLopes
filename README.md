# Hi, everyone!

I am Emanoel Lopes, Front-End Software Engineer (and most all the time, a problem solver) from Brazil, actually working at [Luizalabs](https://github.com/luizalabs). I deal with web development since 2013 in digital agencies, B2C and B2B plataforms, products and softwares as a service and some jobs as a freelancer programmer. 

Enthusiastic about new technologies which allow me to be in constant learning. Usually self-taught, proactive and always positive.

In my spare time, I am an amateur street runner, and I also take time to take care of my physical and mental health through fitness activities and personal hobbies. Oh, and I am also the guardian of 5 cats.
